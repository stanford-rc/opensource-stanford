<small>Got it, yes agree on all points. The only downside with my proposal up above seems to be that epochs will last a long time and are over-estimated by a factor of block size. But the correct thing would be happening as far as training goes. If you squint you can actually see that as correct because technically every window of data is a different example, because each output is conditioned on a slightly different-sized input. So TLDR I'm not too averse to that as the interpretation of "epoch". I'm kind of an enemy of the concept of epochs anyway, I much prefer to think about everything in just raw iterations and multiples there of....</small>
