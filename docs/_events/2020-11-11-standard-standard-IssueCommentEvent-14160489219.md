<small>This issue has morphed from discussion of adding `eslint-config-standard-with-typescript` to the @standard org (which is done) to discussion of how to build in TypeScript support directly into `standard`. I suppose that `ts-standard` removes the pressing need for this by providing a nice happy path for TS users, so we could close this and end discussion of adding TS support directly into `standard` for now if we'd like....</small>
