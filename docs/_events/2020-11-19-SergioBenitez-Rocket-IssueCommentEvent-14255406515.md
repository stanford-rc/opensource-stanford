<small>For posterity, note that since this issue, Rocket has gained the ability to automatically live-reload templates. This is enabled by default when the application is compiled in debug mode. There is no need to use external tools if the desire is to see changes to templates as they happen. If code changes occur elsewhere, however, the suggestion to use tools like `cargo-watch` and `watchexec` remain valid....</small>
