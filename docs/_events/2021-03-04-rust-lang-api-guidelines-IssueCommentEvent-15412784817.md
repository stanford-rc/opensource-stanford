<small>> You can build docs like docs.rs by passing `-Z rustdoc-map` the way it does: [rust-lang/cargo#8296](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/8296). That does require a nightly toolchain, but it's significantly more reliable than `html_root_url`, which most crates _already_ don't set. If you want to go even further, you can build things exactly the same way as docs.rs by using the library we provide: https://github.com/rust-lang/docs.rs/blob/master/crates/metadata/lib.rs#L3....</small>
