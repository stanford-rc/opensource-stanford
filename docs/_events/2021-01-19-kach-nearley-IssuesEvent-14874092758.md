<p>Possible to use Nearley parser with node version 10?</p><small>Nearley produces output that uses array.flat() which doesn't exist in node < 11. Nearley installs just fine, it compiles the grammar.js file, but then when using the parser the code crashes because .flat doesn't exist....</small><a href='https://github.com/kach/nearley/issues/564' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
