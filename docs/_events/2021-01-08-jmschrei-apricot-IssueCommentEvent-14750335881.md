<small>Yes, I think you're doing the right thing. You just need to make sure you evaluate the quality of the subset using the same function, regardless of how you chose the subset. Another thought I had is that, if you're just adding in a "bonus" for each item selected, you might find it easier to modify the FacilityLocationSelection object to take in a vector of "bonuses", one for each example, and add that value to the gain for each item. I don't think you need an actual feature-based function for what you're trying to do. ...</small>
