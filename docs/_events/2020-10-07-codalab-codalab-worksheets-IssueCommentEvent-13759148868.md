<small>Agree the bar might look mysterious/confusing, though maybe something can show up on mouse over?  Or the icon were just smaller?  I think we can mock out a few options against the actual worksheets (look at the worksheets in Gallery and check that they seem reasonable)?  On second thought, maybe we should hold off on the verbose option since we already have a lot of bugs in the frontend, and so I'd be reluctant to add even more complexity....</small>
