<small>I think this is fine to merge. I have a somewhat similar view as Sleevi, but there's really no harm and it might indeed be useful to someone, so I don't see much reason not to. I'll leave final decision to @cpu since I think he might have the the strongest opinions. My one comment would be maybe to move that content out of README to elsewhere....</small>
