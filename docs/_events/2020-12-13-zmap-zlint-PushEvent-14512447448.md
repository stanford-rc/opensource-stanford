<small>CI: Have tld-update workflow build & test pre-PR. (#521)

Once the `tld-update.yml` github workflow job has run `go generate
./...` and potentially created a local diff with updated gTLD data it
should also build & test. This helps ensure that if something goes
haywire and the local diff won't build/run it won't have a PR opened.</small>
