<small>Thanks for giving this a shot. Starting with Renderman is definitely a good idea. It has the extra baggage of boost, but it looks like you got past that. Your error is at this line https://github.com/fedden/RenderMan/blob/33213e50b7096a419db1186f89a13cceb659d718/Source/RenderEngine.cpp#L32 so I'm not sure what's wrong with the plugin. Can you try an absolute path to the plugin? Also some std::cout messages in loadPlugin....</small>
