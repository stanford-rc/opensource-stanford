<small>> `rocket::support=info` doesn't quite do what I wanted after all: I was trying to implement "show any messages at `warn` or above, and also any `rocket::support` messages at `info` or above", but it doesn't look like I can do that with `EnvFilter` since the global level `warn` takes precedence....</small>
