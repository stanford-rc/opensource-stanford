<small>One significant downside from not including tests in the uploaded packages is that they won't be run by automated tools like crater. In the past, Rocket's tests have found regressions in `rustc` and have led to us being alerted of inadvertent breaking changes. For this reason alone, I'm hesitant to make this change....</small>
