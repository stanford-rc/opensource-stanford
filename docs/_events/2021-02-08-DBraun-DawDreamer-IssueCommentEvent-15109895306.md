<small>I'm not the biggest fan of brew myself. I only used it because RenderMan previously used it. Maybe these [lines](https://github.com/DBraun/DawDreamer/blob/758e2a76d9b16cfc38693a1103b6522907d5bce6/DawDreamer.jucer#L67-L79) indicate something, but it's similar to what you scoped out in the Xcode file....</small>
