<small>I put some screenshots of my CMake-GUI here https://github.com/DBraun/PyTorchTOP/issues/15#issuecomment-774756385 Can you compare to your setup? I think it's weird that opencv_world451.dll got smaller. Did you include the opencv_modules this time? Also, `C:\Users\me\AppData\` is a hidden folder, so it's not a good place to put files in my opinion....</small>
