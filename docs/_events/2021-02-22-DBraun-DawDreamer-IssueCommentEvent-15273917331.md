<small>Suppose I have a VST with a complicated UI and no ability to save a preset file. Even in this situation, something like Ableton can save the preset, and that's why you can re-open a project and see the user-modified preset. Something like [getStateInformation](https://docs.juce.com/master/tutorial_audio_processor_value_tree_state.html) is probably being used to save the state and pack it into the Ableton project file. However, the content of that state information isn't shown to the user. It would be great to save out these files, but it would require adding a UI as you discussed [here](https://github.com/DBraun/DawDreamer/issues/24#issue-813293762). One could still explore the getStateInformation features before the UI feature is added....</small>
