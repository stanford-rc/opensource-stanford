<small>I have already implemented this and all other 0.5 milestone issues, with the exception of #21 which was implemented by @jebrosen and @hawkw, so any efforts to implement this feature would be duplicated. Due to our standards for code quality, usability, and robustness, committing the changes upstream takes longer than you might expect. Nevertheless, you'll see this issue be closed very soon....</small>
