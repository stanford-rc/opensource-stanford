<small>If A and B share a common child, by definition they cannot be completely independent with a standard conditional probability table. Logical ORs/ANDs can be used in the place of conditional probability tables to decrease the parameterization, but I don't think that renders the parents independent. For instance, in an extreme example, imagine that C was only 1 when both A and B were 1. If you knew that C was 1, that would propagate backward through the network. One of the reasons that Bayesian networks are so popular is that inference flows both ways....</small>
