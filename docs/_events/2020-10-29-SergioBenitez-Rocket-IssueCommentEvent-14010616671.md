<small>@luisvonmuller The fix should either be upsteam, in `hyper` itself, or as an adapter of some sort, like https://github.com/hjr3/hyper-timeout but for servers. Unfortunately, other issues in `hyper` may prevent the latter kind of solution from working at all (https://github.com/hjr3/hyper-timeout/issues/12)....</small>
