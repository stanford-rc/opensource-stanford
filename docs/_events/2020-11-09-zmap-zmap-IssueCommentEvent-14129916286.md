<small>I suspect that either RSTs or duplicates are coming through. The default mode in ZMap filters these out, but when you choose a different output module it inherits an empty output module. If you used `--output-module=csv`, then I think that they'd be the same number. If you want to filter those out, then an `--output-filter` can help you get there. ...</small>
