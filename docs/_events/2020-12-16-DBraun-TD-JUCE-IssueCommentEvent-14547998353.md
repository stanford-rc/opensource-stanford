<small>Hello, thanks for giving it a try. I assume you're using Windows 64. It seems to be this line: https://github.com/DBraun/TD-JUCE/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt#L15 I think this implies that the cmake variable `CMAKE_VS_PLATFORM_NAME` is already set. Looking it up, https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_VS_PLATFORM_NAME_DEFAULT.html#variable:CMAKE_VS_PLATFORM_NAME_DEFAULT this might mean you're using visual studio 2017. Is that true? Would you mind using Visual Studio 2019 instead?...</small>
