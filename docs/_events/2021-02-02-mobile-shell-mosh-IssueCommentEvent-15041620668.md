<small>The truth is that our maintainer is on hiatus and we haven't made a release since 2017. However, our security track record remains infinitely better than any comparable project (OpenSSH, OpenSSL, etc.). We have never had a major security hole since Mosh 1.0 was released nine years ago. We're pretty proud of that! It's worth a considerable amount of confidence....</small>
