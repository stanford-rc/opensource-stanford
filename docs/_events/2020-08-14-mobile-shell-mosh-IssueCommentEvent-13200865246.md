<small>Mosh doesn't support the "alternate screen" part of the xterm terminal spec, so everything is just on the same screen. The screen isn't corrupted, it just doesn't maintain two screens and flip between them. This is unlikely to be changed anytime soon. (You don't have to uninstall Mosh to get the normal behavior, though -- you can always just use SSH if you want. Or you can use Mosh and then use tmux on the remote host.)...</small>
