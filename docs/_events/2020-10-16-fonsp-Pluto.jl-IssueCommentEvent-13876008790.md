<small>@NaNotia nice to have VSCode text manipulation, ability to open library files that you may use in Pluto with Revise, minimap, unified settings / configuration, bookmarks, built-in terminal, plugins, .... that's a lot of functionality that would take a full-time team of 10+ people a couple years to create....</small>
