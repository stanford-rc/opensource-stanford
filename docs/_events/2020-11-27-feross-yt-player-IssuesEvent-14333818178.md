<p>Listeners not working</p><small>I am using this in my application and it has been working properly for a while but occasionally it will just break and none of the listeners will function properly (any instance of a .on I have in my app is no longer working). This has happened once before and I started working on a workaround but then the problem went away. But now it's broken again. Please let me know if this is fixable or I should find another solution....</small><a href='https://github.com/feross/yt-player/issues/63' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
