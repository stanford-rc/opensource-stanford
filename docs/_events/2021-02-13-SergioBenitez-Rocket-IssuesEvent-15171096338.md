<p>Discussions Tab</p><small>Hi, may I suggest something that may help for newbies? Opening the discussions tab for this repository? Sorry for making an issue for this but, the "Discussions" tab would be very useful for not much important stuff, like helps, guides, and etc. And I must say that Rocket is awesome!.. Thanks for this awesome repo. Good luck!.....</small><a href='https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket/issues/1530' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
