<small>Hello, thanks for trying out the project. I'm optimistic that you'll get this working soon. I recommend starting from scratch and cloning the repo with git. This will use git submodules to download JUCE_5 and JUCE_6 to the thirdparty folder. As you figured out, the submodules have been set up so that JUCE_5 contains the old VST SDK that is currently missing from JUCE_6. I intend to periodically update JUCE_6 to get the latest features, whereas JUCE_5 will stay as is (with some bloat) just to have the old SDK around....</small>
