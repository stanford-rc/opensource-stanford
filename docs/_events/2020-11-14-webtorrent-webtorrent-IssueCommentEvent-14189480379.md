<small>@vankasteelj Do you know when exactly the DLL initialization error occurs? Can you try, for example, adding a line like `console.log('after utp-native require)` after the `require('utp-native')` line? If it's possible for us to put a try-catch around this line, and make `utp-native` into an `optionalDependency`, then I'm happy to do that....</small>
